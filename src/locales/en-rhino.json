                "answer": "Rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that reshapes or repairs the nose. It can be performed for cosmetic purposes to improve the appearance of the nose or for functional purposes to correct breathing problems."
            },
            {
                "question": "Am I a good candidate for rhinoplasty?",
                "answer": "Good candidates for rhinoplasty are individuals who are in good overall health, have realistic expectations about the outcomes, and are seeking improvement in the appearance or function of their nose. A consultation with Dr. Kalkavan will help determine if you are a suitable candidate."
            },
            {
                "question": "How long does the rhinoplasty surgery take?",
                "answer": "Rhinoplasty surgery typically takes between 1.5 to 3 hours, depending on the complexity of the procedure and the techniques used."
            },
            {
                "question": "How long is the recovery period?",
                "answer": "Initial recovery takes about 1-2 weeks, during which you may experience swelling and bruising. Most patients can return to work after 7-10 days. Full results are visible after 6-12 months as the swelling completely subsides."
            },
            {
                "question": "Will I have visible scars after surgery?",
                "answer": "With closed rhinoplasty, all incisions are made inside the nose, leaving no visible scars. Open rhinoplasty involves a small incision on the columella, which typically heals to become nearly invisible."
            },
            {
                "question": "How many rhinoplasty surgeries has Dr. Can Kalkavan performed?",
